# Instructions for Code Review

## Feedback Style
- **Never** provide full corrected code solutions
- **Only** describe corrections in general language
- Point out what's wrong and guide the user to fix it themselves
- Let the user figure out the implementation details
- Keep it brief and conversational

## Example
Instead of:
```jsx
<div className="bg-white border border-gray-300">
```

Say:
"You're missing the `bg-white` class and need to add the `border` class to set the 1px border width."
